I am an IT professional transitioning into cybersecurity after over 10 years of experience in network administration and IT infrastructure. As a recent graduate with a Certificate IV in Cyber Security from TAFE Queensland, I'm passionate about building practical skills through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios.

## Objective
To demonstrate my progression from IT infrastructure professional to SOC Analyst through hands-on cybersecurity projects that showcase real-world incident detection, threat analysis, and security monitoring capabilities. Each project is designed to build upon my existing network administration expertise while developing specialised skills in threat hunting, incident response, and security operations centre workflows.
