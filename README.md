I am an IT professional transitioning into cybersecurity after over 10 years of experience in network administration and IT infrastructure. As a recent graduate with a Certificate IV in Cyber Security from TAFE Queensland, I'm passionate about building practical skills through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios.

## Objective
To demonstrate my progression from IT infrastructure professional to SOC Analyst through hands-on cybersecurity projects that showcase real-world incident detection, threat analysis, and security monitoring capabilities, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Centre (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. Each project is designed to build upon my existing network administration expertise while developing specialised skills in threat hunting, incident response, and security operations centre workflows.
